    <summary>Approach to Develop the App</summary>
<br />

- **Project Setup:**

  - Used a tool Create React App to set up a new React.js project.
  - Install the necessary dependencies, including Redux Toolkit, React Redux, React Router and other relevant packages.

- **Design and Wireframing:**

  - Started by creating wireframes or mockups for mobile app's user interface. This helped me plan the layout and design.
  - I prioritize a clean and intuitive design for small screens, ensuring a seamless user experience on mobile devices.

- **Mobile-First Component Development:**

  - Developed individual React components with a mobile-first mindset. Started with the smallest screen size (e.g., mobile phones) and progressively enhance for larger screens (tablets and desktops).
  - Utilized responsive design techniques, such as CSS media queries, to adjust component layouts and styles for different screen sizes.

- **Responsive Styling:**

  - Implemented a mobile-first approach in styles by defining the default styles for mobile screens and then using media queries to apply styles for larger screens.

- **React Router for Navigation:**

  - Implemented React Router to handle navigation within the app.
  - Defined routes and route components, ensuring that the navigation flows smoothly on both small and large screens.

- **Redux Setup and State Management:**

  - Configured the Redux store using Redux Toolkit. Created slices to manage different parts of the application's state such as userSlice, CartSlice, wishlistSlice, usersListSlice, filtersSlice, productsSlice, productDetailsSlice etc.
  - Created different methods to add, remove, update, delete the different states.

- **API Integration:**

  - Used HTTP fetch method to connect the mobile app to the backend API for fetching data and performing CRUD operations.
  - Implemented Redux actions and reducers to manage the application's data flow.
  - Here in this case used fake API's to fetch the data and based on response status (pending, success, failure) implemented the locally available data to render the UI.

- **Debugging and Debug Tools:**

  - Used browser developer tools and React DevTools for debugging and inspecting component states.
  - Implemented logging and error handling to catch and handle issues gracefully.

- **Deployment:**

  - Prepared the app for deployment by configuring build scripts, optimizing assets, and setting up a production environment.
  - Choosed a hosting platform Netlify for deploying Myglass App.
